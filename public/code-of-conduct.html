        <p>Harassment includes conduct such as offensive verbal comments, sexual images in public spaces, intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other activities, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing or inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

        <p>Expo halls, sponsor booths, vendor booths, and similar locations or activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. Exhibitors, booth staff, volunteers and all others participating in any way at the event are expected conduct themselves in a professional and businesslike manner. We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social events.</p>
